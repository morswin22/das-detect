# DAS Detect
Detecting Moving Objects in [DAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_acoustic_sensing) Recordings

## Project Goal
Develop an algorithm to detect and track moving objects in acoustic data collected from a Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) system attached to the fiber optic cable at Jana Pawla II Street.

- [x] Filter out the noise and process the data in suach a way that only moving objects (slanted lines) are visible.
- [x] Determine the velocity of these objects.
- [ ] Draw a graph of the speed changing over time.
- [ ] Add clustering of objects into several groups differing in the nature of the signal, e.g. thick line, narrow line, objects with constant speed, objects with changing speed.

## Input data
The data can be obtained [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lJKLz3LsQmnAf9q5GGi6arEYBz-3CMhx/view?usp=sharing).
